DAFE version 2.0.0

The DAFE suite consists of perl and R scripts and a colleciton of perl and R
libraries for analyzing Differentially Abundanct Functional Elements in
metagenomes.  It relies on a database of references (i.e. genomes).  Metagenome
reads are mapped to each reference.  Functional elements (i.e. genes ) from
each reference are annotated as differentially abundant between metagenome
sample types.
